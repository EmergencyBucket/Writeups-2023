docker build -t random-security .
docker run -p 5000:80 random-security

## Solution
The solution is to predit the next ``Math.random()`` the program spits out.

Use the following method to reverse engineer the random values.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Random;

public class ReplicatedRandom extends Random {
    // Replicate the state of a Random using a single value from its nextDouble
    public boolean replicateState(double nextDouble) {
        // nextDouble() is generated from ((next(26) << 27) + next(27)) / (1L << 53)
        // Inverting those operations will get us the values of next(26) and next(27)
        long numerator = (long)(nextDouble * (1L << 53));
        int first26 = (int)(numerator >>> 27);
        int last27 = (int)(numerator & ((1L << 27) - 1));
        return replicateState(first26, 26, last27, 27);
    }

    public boolean replicateState(int nextN, int n, int nextM, int m) {
        // Constants copied from java.util.Random
        final long multiplier = 0x5DEECE66DL;
        final long addend = 0xBL;
        final long mask = (1L << 48) - 1;

        long upperMOf48Mask = ((1L << m) - 1) << (48 - m);

        // next(x) is generated by taking the upper x bits of 48 bits of (oldSeed * multiplier + addend) mod (mask + 1)
        // So now we have the upper n and m bits of two consecutive calls of next(n) and next(m)
        long oldSeedUpperN = ((long)nextN << (48 - n)) & mask;
        long newSeedUpperM = ((long)nextM << (48 - m)) & mask;

        // Bruteforce the lower (48 - n) bits of the oldSeed that was truncated.
        // Calculate the next seed for each guess of oldSeed and check if it has the same top m bits as our newSeed.
        // If it does then the guess is right and we can add that to our candidate seeds.
        ArrayList<Long> possibleSeeds = new ArrayList<Long>();
        for (long oldSeed = oldSeedUpperN; oldSeed <= (oldSeedUpperN | ((1L << (48 - n)) - 1)); oldSeed++) {
            long newSeed = (oldSeed * multiplier + addend) & mask;
            if ((newSeed & upperMOf48Mask) == newSeedUpperM) {
                possibleSeeds.add(newSeed);
            }
        }

        if (possibleSeeds.size() == 1) {
            // If there's only one candidate seed, then we found it!
            setSeed(possibleSeeds.get(0) ^ multiplier); // setSeed(x) sets seed to `(x ^ multiplier) & mask`, so we need another `^ multiplier` to cancel it out
            return true;
        }
        if (possibleSeeds.size() >= 1) {
            System.out.println("Didn't find a unique seed. Possible seeds were: " + possibleSeeds);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed to find seed!");
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
