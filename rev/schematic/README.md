# Schematic - Easy

### Files
[Schematic](schematic.schematic)

## Description
I was build a tnt cannon, how many dispensers am I using.

Put the number in: `bucket{number_goes_here}`

## Solve
Schematic files are used by the Minecraft mod schematica to define a set of blocks. Using the mod and loading the schematic, you can go into the move schematic menu, click resources and see the exact number of dispensers. This challenge is also solvable using many online tools to either display schematics or convert them to a human readable format.
